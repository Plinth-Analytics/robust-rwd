This repository supports a demonstration of the `pointblank` R package as applied to CMS Synthetic Public Use Files

# Data source

["CMS DE-SynPUF"](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Downloadable-Public-Use-Files/SynPUFs/DE_Syn_PUF) (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Data Entrepreneurs' Synthetic Public Use File) are a synthetic set of tables that reflect how Medicare data are often organized for researchers. 

Medicare data can take significant effort to [extract/transform/load](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load) before they're ready for analysis, and if you let others do the ETL then you may need to make sure the data are as-expected.
